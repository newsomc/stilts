Some notes:

- On debian, you will need to install the following packages in addition to smlnj:
    libckit-smlnj libmlnlffi-smlnj ml-nlffigen ml-lex ml-yacc ml-lpt

- ml-yacc will fail a few times like so:
Usage: ml-yacc filename
../db/squall/squall.cm:5.2-5.11 Error: tool "ML-Yacc" failed: "/usr/lib/smlnj/bin/ml-yacc" "" "input.grm"

  Run ml-yacc filename by hand. (Argh, SML/NJ.)
